"""
Sound change parser.

This module holds the functions, methods, and data for parsing sound
changes from strings. While it was first specified as a formal grammar,
by means of a Parsing Expression Grammar, it is now implemented "manually",
mostly using simple string manipulations and regular expressions with
no look-behinds. The decision to change was motivated by the growing
complexity of the grammar that had to hold a mutable set of graphemes
and for the plans of expansion/conversion to different programming
languages, trying to diminish the dependency on Python.
