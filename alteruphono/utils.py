    Returns a list of graphemes matching a feature description.

    Graphemes are returned according to their definition in the transcription

    regular expressions.

    For example, asking for not-rounded and not high front vowels:

    >>> alteruphono.utils.features2graphemes("[vowel,front,-rounded,-high]")
    ['ẽ̞ẽ̞', 'ãã', 'a̰ːː', 'ẽẽ', 'e̞e̞', ... 'a', 'e', 'i', 'æ', 'ɛ']

    ----------

        A string with the description of feature constraints.

    -------
