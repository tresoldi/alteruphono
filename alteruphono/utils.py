def features2graphemes(feature_str, transsys=None):

    Returns a list of graphemes matching a feature description.

    Graphemes are returned according to their definition in the transcription
    system in use. The list of graphemes is sorted first by inverse length
    and then alphabetically, so that it can conveniently be mapped to
    regular expressions.

    For example, asking for not-rounded and not high front vowels:

    >>> alteruphono.utils.features2graphemes("[vowel,front,-rounded,-high]")
    ['ẽ̞ẽ̞', 'ãã', 'a̰ːː', 'ẽẽ', 'e̞e̞', ... 'a', 'e', 'i', 'æ', 'ɛ']

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_str : string
        A string with the description of feature constraints.
    transsys : TranscriptionSystem
        The transcription system to be used. Defaults to BIPA.

    Returns
    -------
    sounds : list
        A sorted list of all the graphemes matching the requested feature
        constraints.
