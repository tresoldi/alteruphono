"""
Defines class for building reconstruction replacements from ASTs.

Internally, both forward and back reconstructions work by first
translating the ASTs into simple objects, all inheriting from
class `Primitive`, which offer a `.__repr__()` method, for debugging,
and a `.to_regex()` method for generating the regular expression
representation. `IterPrimitive` works as a list, allowing to
collect either Expressions or Sequences.
