"""
Development script for downloading CLTS data and building local resources.

The script is used to pre-process and cache some expansive computations
needed by `alteruphono`, such as those returned by `features2graphemes()`.
It also allows to remove the dependency on `pyclts` and associated
libraries, which is necessary for preparing the Golang version of
the library.
